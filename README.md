<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is my THIRD project working with Tkinter(GUI), and the first time working with the databaseüòÄ. This is my 1st year mini project as well. Hope you all like itüòÅ

The software system is an online blood bank management system that helps in managing various blood bank operations effectively. The project consists of a central repository containing various blood deposits available along with associated details. These details include blood type, storage area and date of storage. These details help in maintaining and monitoring the blood deposits. The project is an online system that allows to check weather required blood deposits of a particular group are available in the blood bank. Moreover the system also has added features such as patient name and contacts, blood booking and even need foe certain blood group is posted on the website to find available donors for a blood emergency.

This online system is made using Python(tkinter) and SQLite3.

### Advantages
* Helps Blood Banks to automate blood doner and depository online.
* Encourages blood donors to donate.
* Helps people find blood donors in times of need.
### Disadvantages
* Does not keep track of big data.

### Modules
